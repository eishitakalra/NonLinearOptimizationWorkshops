 Conjugate Gradient Direction:
     calculates the next conjugate gradient search direction

 - it needs to be passed the previous gk and pk
 
 - there are variants to calculate bk based on Fletcher Reeves or Polack-Riv

 - it can be linked with the generic line search method and
   different line searches
 
 Called as pkp =  CGDirection(gkp, gk, pk), where
   - gkp is the gradient at x_{k+1} (calculated outside this method)
