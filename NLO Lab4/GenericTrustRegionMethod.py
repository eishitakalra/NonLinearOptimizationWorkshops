"""
 Generic Trust Region Method: applies a generic trust region method to
 optimize a given function

 Can choose between different ways to solve the TR subproblem:
  - L_1 exact (by a QP solver)
  - L_2 exact (by Levenberg Marquardt)
  - L_2 approximate (by dog-leg)

 will return the path taken by the method (so that it can be plotted later)

 Called as path = GTRM(x0, function, tol);

 where
   x0 = starting point
   function = the function to be minimized
          [assumes that the function can be called as
           function(0, x), function(1, x), function(2, x)]
   tol = the convergence tolerance: iterate until || nabla f(x)|| < tol

 possible calling sequence is
